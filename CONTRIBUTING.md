# Contributing

Contributions from community are key to making purpleteam a high quality comprehensive resource. Lets make purpleteam awesome together!

## Ways to Contribute

Depending on your preference, you can contribute in various ways.

Usually the best approach is to discus what you're thinking of or planning first. You can do this by:

* Starting a [Github Discussion](https://github.com/purpleteam-labs/purpleteam/discussions)
* Having a chat about it on the purpleteam-labs [Slack](https://purpleteam-labs.slack.com). If you need an invite DM us on Twitter [@purpleteamlabs](https://twitter.com/purpleteamlabs), or reachout via the BinaryMist website [contact section](https://binarymist.io/#contact)

The purpleteam-labs [Backlog/Project board](https://github.com/purpleteam-labs/purpleteam/projects/2) lists work items waiting for someone to start work on. These can be a good place to start.

We also have a [Roadmap](https://github.com/purpleteam-labs/purpleteam/projects/1) for Epics a little further out.

You can also [open an issue](https://github.com/purpleteam-labs/purpleteam/issues/new/choose), or send a Pull Request.



If you modify existing code that has tests for it, please modify the tests first to help you drive your development and make sure they are passing before submitting a Pull Request.  
If you modify existing code that does not yet have tests, please create tests for the modified code and make sure they are passing before submitting a Pull Request.  
If you create new code, please drive that creation with tests, include the tests in your Pull Request.

eslint needs to be producing no errors before submitting a Pull Request
